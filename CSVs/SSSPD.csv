Portfolio,Craft & Visual Design: ,"This is the executional quality of the work. It encompasses a designer's strong command of typography, layout, color, and spacing, ensuring UIs are clean, consistent, and well-structured. It also includes the demonstration of taste, a refined visual sensibility that results in designs that ""just look good"" and feel balanced and intentional. Prototyping and AI-driven design are also crucial here; designers should be able to create high-fidelity prototypes to share with the team and explore emerging tools like AI to enhance their workflow.","Visuals are functional but standard. Relies heavily on existing templates or systems without adding value. Prototypes are basic or static. Lack of personal building or ""builder"" mindset.	","Strong visual craft and professional presentation. Follows established patterns well and produces clean work. Includes prototypes, but innovation in tooling or method is limited.        ",A portfolio demonstrating exceptional building skills and taste; ability to set new design standards and patterns; masterfully uses advanced prototyping and AI tools.        ,"Sets industry benchmarks for craft. Defines entirely new visual languages or interaction paradigms. Work is visionary and demonstrates ""builder"" capabilities that rival front-end engineering.

,Product Sense & Strategy:,"This competency is about understanding the broader business context and how design directly contributes to product goals and business outcomes. It’s about being a strategic partner, challenging low-impact features, and contributing to the roadmap. Designs should be intentional and grounded in data, leveraging both qualitative and quantitative insights to validate decisions and frame them as testable hypotheses.",Focuses on execution of features handed down. Understanding of business impact is theoretical or limited to basic metrics. Reacts to roadmaps rather than shaping them.        ,"Connects design work to clear business outcomes. Can explain the ""why"" behind features. Projects have impact, but scope is usually limited to a specific product area or feature set.	",Demonstrates deep strategic insight that shapes product roadmaps; identifies and unlocks new business opportunities; decisions transform the platform and drive revenue.        ,Defines long-term product vision (1-3 years). Identify entire market pivots or new business lines through design. Strategy influences the company's direction at the executive level.
,Communication,"Clear, confident communication is essential for Deel designers. They must be skilled storytellers who can articulate design decisions with clarity and purpose, tailoring their message to suit different audiences. Beyond simply presenting work, they ""sell"" their design vision - bringing others along the journey through persuasive narratives that connect design rationale to user needs and business impact.","Communication is clear but linear. Explains ""what"" was done but misses the persuasive ""why."" Struggles to engage senior stakeholders or summarize complex context.        ","Communication shows some structure but lacks depth or consistency. Explanations are partial or overly wordy, suggesting excessive reliance on AI-generated text.","Synthesizes complex ambiguity into clear strategic direction; ensures alignment across diverse stakeholders through persuasive narrative; articulates trade-offs effectively to unblock decision-making.
","Acts as a strategic partner to executive leadership; uses communication to fundamentally shift organizational culture or product vision; narrative skills are so compelling they serve as a primary driver for business strategy.

,User-centered problem solving,"This is the foundation of great UX. It's the ability to define and simplify complex user problems and create intuitive, elegant, and user-centered solutions. This includes framing problems clearly, mapping pain points, thinking through all possible states and edge cases, and catching them early in the process.","Focuses primarily on surface-level execution; accepts briefs without questioning or validating the underlying problem. Process is linear, lacking rigor in research or validation. Fails to anticipate edge cases or technical constraints, resulting in brittle solutions.
","Applies a structured, standard UX process to solve well-defined problems effectively. Conducts research and validation for specific features. However, the scope is often limited to a single workflow, lacking connection to the broader product ecosystem or deeper business strategy.","Thrives in high ambiguity to define and solve systemic problems; connects user needs across multiple product surfaces; solutions address root causes rather than symptoms and account for technical scalability.
