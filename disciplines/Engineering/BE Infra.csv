Functional Skills: technical or job-related skills that are necessary to perform tasks within a particular role,Database Design,"Candidate struggles with fundamental database concepts, unable to define primary/foreign keys, identify correct table relationships (e.g., one-to-many vs. many-to-many), or apply basic normalization principles (e.g., repeating groups). May propose designs with significant data redundancy or lack clear entity relationships. Requires constant guidance for even simple schema tasks.","Candidate can design functional schemas for straightforward problems, but often overlooks critical details such as appropriate data types, effective indexing for performance, or proper handling of null values. Shows limited understanding of the impact of schema changes on existing systems and may lack robust strategies for safe database migrations (e.g., transaction management, rollback plans).","Candidate designs correct and well-structured schemas, demonstrating a solid understanding of data modeling, relationships, and normalization. Considers the implications of schema changes and proposes some effective strategies for migrations, including understanding the need for backward compatibility or using basic schema versioning. Can optimize designs for specific use cases (e.g., read-heavy systems) and articulate trade-offs.","Candidate demonstrates complete mastery of database design principles, creating robust, scalable, and highly performant architectures. Consistently accounts for complex edge cases (e.g., large data volumes, concurrent access, distributed systems), and develops comprehensive, safe production migration plans that include detailed steps, monitoring, and contingency plans. Designs for high availability, disaster recovery, and advanced indexing techniques. Acts as a mentor and sets best practices."
,Troubleshooting,"Candidate struggles to articulate thoughts clearly and concisely; ideas are fragmented, poorly structured, and difficult for the audience (technical or non-technical) to follow. Uses jargon inappropriately or fails to adapt communication style.","Candidate can convey basic ideas but often struggles with clarity, conciseness, or adapting the message to the audience. May require prompting to elaborate and may use overly technical language when explaining to non-technical stakeholders, leading to misunderstandings.","Candidate expresses ideas clearly and understandably, with occasional minor missteps in structure or tone. Can effectively explain technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences, fostering a general understanding, though complex nuances might require further clarification.","Candidate consistently articulates complex technical information with exceptional clarity, precision, and an appropriate tone for any audience. Expertly adapts communication style, fosters deep understanding, influences decision-making, and builds shared vision within the team and with stakeholders. Proactively identifies communication gaps."
,System Architecture,"Candidate demonstrates reluctance to engage in teamwork, struggles to share knowledge, or exhibits unconstructive conflict resolution. Prioritizes individual tasks over team goals, negatively impacting team cohesion and overall productivity.","Candidate participates in team activities but may struggle with active listening, sharing knowledge proactively, or effectively resolving conflicts. Requires explicit guidance to contribute meaningfully to collective problem-solving and may occasionally hinder team progress.","Candidate actively collaborates with team members, willingly shares knowledge, and generally resolves conflicts constructively. Contributes positively to the team environment, helps achieve shared goals, and supports other team members, fulfilling role requirements for teamwork.","Candidate is an exemplary collaborator, proactively seeking opportunities to work with others, fostering an inclusive environment, and consistently driving positive outcomes through teamwork. Mentors peers, mediates conflicts effectively, and significantly enhances team productivity and morale. Champions collective success and knowledge sharing."
Business Impact: skills that influence on the overall success and strategic direction of the organization,Problem solving / Critical Thinking,"Candidate struggles to identify a clear learning process or steps taken when faced with new skills/technologies. Requires extensive prompting to recall details and cannot articulate the outcome or any specific learnings, showing resistance to or difficulty with new information.","Candidate can describe a situation where they learned a new skill/technology but the approach is often reactive or unplanned. Can explain the basic outcome but struggles to connect it to broader learnings or future application, indicating a foundational understanding but limited proactive engagement.","Candidate effectively describes a structured approach to learning new skills/technologies, including resources and steps taken. Clearly articulates the positive outcome and identifies specific learnings that have been or could be incorporated into future scenarios, demonstrating a strong capacity for self-directed learning and application.","Candidate consistently demonstrates an exceptional ability to quickly and strategically learn and integrate new skills/technologies. They proactively seek out learning opportunities, develop innovative approaches to accelerate learning, articulate significant positive outcomes, and actively apply and share their learnings to mentor others and drive continuous improvement within the team."
