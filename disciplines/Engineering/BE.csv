Functional Skills: technical or job-related skills that are necessary to perform tasks within a particular role,Database Design,"Candidate struggles with fundamental database concepts, unable to define primary/foreign keys, identify correct table relationships (e.g., one-to-many vs. many-to-many), or apply basic normalization principles (e.g., repeating groups). May propose designs with significant data redundancy or lack clear entity relationships. Requires constant guidance for even simple schema tasks.","Candidate can design functional schemas for straightforward problems, but often overlooks critical details such as appropriate data types, effective indexing for performance, or proper handling of null values. Shows limited understanding of the impact of schema changes on existing systems and may lack robust strategies for safe database migrations (e.g., transaction management, rollback plans).","Candidate designs correct and well-structured schemas, demonstrating a solid understanding of data modeling, relationships, and normalization. Considers the implications of schema changes and proposes some effective strategies for migrations, including understanding the need for backward compatibility or using basic schema versioning. Can optimize designs for specific use cases (e.g., read-heavy systems) and articulate trade-offs.","Candidate demonstrates complete mastery of database design principles, creating robust, scalable, and highly performant architectures. Consistently accounts for complex edge cases (e.g., large data volumes, concurrent access, distributed systems), and develops comprehensive, safe production migration plans that include detailed steps, monitoring, and contingency plans. Designs for high availability, disaster recovery, and advanced indexing techniques. Acts as a mentor and sets best practices."
,Troubleshooting,"Candidate struggles with basic diagnostic steps, relies entirely on guesswork, or panics when encountering errors. Fails to use logs or monitoring effectively and is unable to articulate the steps taken or the root cause of an issue. Requires constant supervision to resolve even simple, pre-identified issues.","Candidate can follow a prescribed troubleshooting guide or checklist for known issues but struggles with novel or complex problems. They can identify symptoms but often misdiagnose the root cause. Requires periodic support for deep dives and may take an inefficient, trial-and-error approach to resolution.","Candidate employs a systematic, logical approach to diagnosing and resolving a wide range of issues, including novel ones. They effectively use monitoring tools and logs to pinpoint the root cause and propose robust, long-term solutions. Can work independently on complex problems, only escalating when necessary.","Candidate is an expert diagnostician who anticipates failure modes and designs systems with observability in mind. They can resolve critical production incidents under extreme pressure, rapidly isolate issues in unfamiliar systems, and lead post-mortems that drive systemic, preventative architectural changes."
,System Architecture,"Candidate struggles to articulate the overall structure or components of a simple system. Proposes monolithic designs without considering common architectural patterns, scalability, security, or trade-offs (e.g., synchronous vs. asynchronous). Requires substantial guidance to draft a basic architecture diagram.","Candidate can design functional systems for a defined, small-scale problem, but often defaults to familiar patterns without critical justification. They may overlook critical non-functional requirements (e.g., effective monitoring, fault tolerance, cost). Requires periodic support to make critical architectural trade-offs or to design for future growth.","Candidate designs well-structured, scalable systems, effectively applying appropriate architectural patterns (e.g., microservices, event-driven). They can clearly articulate trade-offs, address non-functional requirements, and justify technology choices. Can independently design a system for a moderately complex domain.","Candidate demonstrates complete mastery, designing robust, globally scalable, and highly available architectures that anticipate future needs and organizational growth. They lead the design of complex, cross-functional systems, set architectural standards, and mentor others. Proactively identifies and mitigates long-term technical debt and risk."
