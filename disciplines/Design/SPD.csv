Portfolio,Craft & Visual Design: ,"This is the executional quality of the work. It encompasses a designer's strong command of typography, layout, color, and spacing, ensuring UIs are clean, consistent, and well-structured. It also includes the demonstration of taste, a refined visual sensibility that results in designs that ""just look good"" and feel balanced and intentional. Prototyping and AI-driven design are also crucial here; designers should be able to create high-fidelity prototypes to share with the team and explore emerging tools like AI to enhance their workflow.","Designs are outdated, inconsistent, or low-quality. Layouts are cluttered, typography and color are weak, and interactive elements are non-functional or missing. Portfolio is poorly organized or unprofessional.","Visual execution is inconsistent. Layout and hierarchy feel uneven; prototypes or animations are rough. Portfolio is functional but carelessly presented, with at least 3 projects from the last 6 years and coverage of both desktop and mobile designs.","Portfolio is professional and not a templated site from a known provider. Visual craft is strong, with polished animations, prototypes, and videos demonstrating good taste.

Work demonstrates AI-assisted design and includes a showreel for quickly skimming all projects."
,Product Sense & Strategy:,"This competency is about understanding the broader business context and how design directly contributes to product goals and business outcomes. It’s about being a strategic partner, challenging low-impact features, and contributing to the roadmap. Designs should be intentional and grounded in data, leveraging both qualitative and quantitative insights to validate decisions and frame them as testable hypotheses.",Shows little or no understanding of business context. Problem is unclear. Design decisions are disconnected from business goals. Impact is vague or unsupported.,"Shows some awareness of business context, but connections to outcomes are weak or inconsistent. Projects tackle a small surface with limited revenue or impact. Problem and business goals are partially defined, and impact is mentioned but not validated.","Clear understanding of business context. Projects cover multiple surfaces and have high revenue or impact. Problem and solution are clearly connected, and the portfolio demonstrates measurable impact through metrics, feedback, qualitative, or observable outcomes.","Demonstrates deep strategic insight. Projects span accross multiple surfaces and fundamentally transform a platform or business. Decisions are closely tied to business goals, with measurable impact and evidence of system-level thinking or influence on the roadmap."
,Communication,"Clear, confident communication is essential for Deel designers.

Beyond simply presenting work, they ""sell"" their design vision - bringing others along the journey through persuasive narratives that connect design rationale to user needs and business impact.","Builds the foundation. Communication is unclear or incomplete. Explanations are missing or vague. Design decisions are not justified. Writing is poor, and hard to navigate.","Communication shows some structure but lacks depth or consistency. Explanations are partial or overly wordy, suggesting excessive reliance on AI-generated text.","Communication is clear, complete, and structured. Explanations are coherent and professional, with a storyline that is easy to follow. Candidate may include a video walking through the product or project, demonstrating effort to explain their work clearly.","Communication is compelling and highly persuasive.

Problem is unclear. Process steps and validation are missing. Edge cases are ignored. Artifacts such as screenshots of post-its or FigJam boards are unreadable or pixelated.,"Basic awareness of UX process. Problem and user context are partially defined. Research is synthesized to highlight main issues, with some validation of the problem. Process steps are described superficially.","Demonstrates structured user-centered problem-solving. Problem is clearly defined. Research covers multiple users across touchpoints, including service design from physical to digital. Considerations may extend to marketing, support, or other cross-functional areas.
