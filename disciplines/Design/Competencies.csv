"Functional Skills: 
technical or job-related skills that are necessary to perform tasks within a particular role",Craft & Visual Design: ,"This is the executional quality of the work. It encompasses a designer's strong command of typography, layout, color, and spacing, ensuring UIs are clean, consistent, and well-structured. It also includes the demonstration of taste, a refined visual sensibility that results in designs that ""just look good"" and feel balanced and intentional. Prototyping and AI-driven design are also crucial here; designers should be able to create high-fidelity prototypes to share with the team and explore emerging tools like AI to enhance their workflow."
"Practices: 
specific methods, techniques, or processes to achieve specific goals",User-Centered Problem Solving:,"This is the foundation of great UX.

This includes framing problems clearly, mapping pain points, thinking through all possible states and edge cases, and catching them early in the process."
,Product Sense & Strategy:,"This competency is about understanding the broader business context and how design directly contributes to product goals and business outcomes. It’s about being a strategic partner, challenging low-impact features, and contributing to the roadmap. Designs should be intentional and grounded in data, leveraging both qualitative and quantitative insights to validate decisions and frame them as testable hypotheses."

They proactively seek and provide feedback, foster trust, and contribute to a supportive, solution-oriented team environment.

,Communication,"Clear, confident communication is essential for Deel designers.

"Business Impact: 
skills that influence on the overall success and strategic direction of the organization",Ownership & Drive:,"This is about a designer's agency and self-motivation. A high-performing designer takes initiative, pushes for quality, and drives work forward without being asked.
