Portfolio,Craft & Visual Design: ,"This is the executional quality of the work. It encompasses a designer's strong command of typography, layout, color, and spacing, ensuring UIs are clean, consistent, and well-structured. It also includes the demonstration of taste, a refined visual sensibility that results in designs that ""just look good"" and feel balanced and intentional. Prototyping and AI-driven design are also crucial here; designers should be able to create high-fidelity prototypes to share with the team and explore emerging tools like AI to enhance their workflow.","Designs are outdated, inconsistent, or low-quality. Layouts are cluttered, typography and color are weak, and interactive elements are non-functional or missing. Portfolio is poorly organized or unprofessional.","Visual execution is inconsistent. Layout and hierarchy feel uneven; prototypes or animations are rough. Portfolio is functional but carelessly presented, with at least 3 projects from the last 6 years and coverage of both desktop and mobile designs.","Portfolio is professional. Visual craft is strong, with polished animations, prototypes, and videos demonstrating good taste. Includes multiple projects, both professional and personal, reflecting a variety of design experience.","Portfolio portrays a highly proactive and versatile designer. Beyond excellent visual craft, the work demonstrates a curiosity to learn and experiment—incorporating motion, new tools, or varied styles. Projects show a ""builder mindset,"" where the designer pushes beyond the basic brief to elevate the final product feel through high-fidelity prototyping and creative exploration.

,Product Sense & Strategy:,"This competency is about understanding the broader business context and how design directly contributes to product goals and business outcomes. It’s about being a strategic partner, challenging low-impact features, and contributing to the roadmap. Designs should be intentional and grounded in data, leveraging both qualitative and quantitative insights to validate decisions and frame them as testable hypotheses.",Shows little or no understanding of business context. Problem is unclear. Design decisions are disconnected from business goals. Impact is vague or unsupported.,"Shows some awareness of business context, but connections to outcomes are weak or inconsistent. Projects tackle a small surface with limited revenue or impact. Problem and business goals are partially defined, and impact is mentioned but not validated.",Clear understanding of the problem and business context for the assigned scope. Design decisions are visibly connected to the stated goals. The portfolio includes basic success metrics (quantitative or qualitative) or user feedback to validate the work.,"Demonstrates strong product thinking. The designer connects their specific feature work to broader business objectives or metrics (e.g., retention, conversion). Shows initiative by referencing competitor analysis or data to justify decisions, proving they look beyond the immediate ticket."
,Communication,"Clear, confident communication is essential for Deel designers. They must be skilled storytellers who can articulate design decisions with clarity and purpose, tailoring their message to suit different audiences. Beyond simply presenting work, they ""sell"" their design vision - bringing others along the journey through persuasive narratives that connect design rationale to user needs and business impact.","Builds the foundation. Communication is unclear or incomplete. Explanations are missing or vague. Design decisions are not justified. Writing is poor, and hard to navigate.","Communication shows some structure but lacks depth or consistency. Explanations are partial or overly wordy, suggesting excessive reliance on AI-generated text.","Communication is structured and logical. Case studies follow a clear narrative arc (e.g., Problem → Solution →Result) without unnecessary fluff. Explanations of why decisions were made are present. May include a walkthrough video or clear visual summaries to aid understanding.","Communication is engaging and dynamic. The designer moves beyond static text, proactively using formats like short video walkthroughs, GIFs, or interactive demos to simulate the final experience. The narrative clearly articulates the ""why"" behind decisions, demonstrating a deep ownership of the project from start to finish."
,User-centered problem solving,"This is the foundation of great UX. It's the ability to define and simplify complex user problems and create intuitive, elegant, and user-centered solutions. This includes framing problems clearly, mapping pain points, thinking through all possible states and edge cases, and catching them early in the process.",Little to no evidence of user-centered thinking. Problem is unclear. Process steps and validation are missing. Edge cases are ignored.
